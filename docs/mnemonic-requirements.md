## Overview

Mnemonic solves the problem of inconsistent tooling and isolated knowledge in teams using Claude Code.
See [mnemonic-concept.md](mnemonic-concept.md) for the full problem statement and rationale.

Mnemonic must provide two primary capabilities: a searchable team knowledge base and a synchronized
tooling library. An admin REST API handles all writes; a read-only MCP interface serves Claude Code.

## Knowledge Management

<a id="km-1"></a>**KM-1.** Mnemonic must store team knowledge as named, searchable patterns. Each pattern has a name,
description, content body (up to 10KB), and optional tags.

<a id="km-2"></a>**KM-2.** Mnemonic must support semantic search over patterns so that a natural-language query
returns the most relevant patterns by meaning, not just keyword match.

<a id="km-3"></a>**KM-3.** Mnemonic must expose relationships between patterns so that a caller can discover patterns
related to a given pattern by shared concepts or associations.

<a id="km-4"></a>**KM-4.** Mnemonic must track the enrichment state of each pattern (pending, enriched, failed) and
only include fully enriched patterns in semantic search results.

<a id="km-5"></a>**KM-5.** Mnemonic must retry failed pattern enrichment and surface enrichment errors to
administrators.

<a id="km-6"></a>**KM-6.** Mnemonic must allow patterns to be associated with specific agents, with a relevance score
per association.

## Tooling Management

<a id="tm-1"></a>**TM-1.** Mnemonic must store agent definitions as named, retrievable documents.

<a id="tm-2"></a>**TM-2.** Mnemonic must store skill definitions as named, retrievable documents. Skills may include
child files (scripts, references, assets) that are returned as part of the skill definition.

<a id="tm-3"></a>**TM-3.** Mnemonic must store command definitions as named, retrievable documents.

<a id="tm-4"></a>**TM-4.** Mnemonic must enforce consistent naming rules for agents, skills, and commands so that
names are URL-safe and predictable.

<a id="tm-5"></a>**TM-5.** Mnemonic must support full create, update, and delete operations for all tooling types via
the admin API.

<a id="tm-6"></a>**TM-6.** Mnemonic must detect whether a tooling definition has changed since it was last stored,
without requiring a full content comparison.

## Tooling Synchronization

<a id="ts-1"></a>**TS-1.** Mnemonic must expose a synchronization manifest that a client can use to determine which
agents, skills, and commands are new or changed since the client last synced.

<a id="ts-2"></a>**TS-2.** The synchronization manifest must include enough information for a client to fetch only
what has changed, enabling incremental sync.

<a id="ts-3"></a>**TS-3.** Mnemonic must return complete skill definitions including all child files in a single
response, so a sync client does not need multiple round-trips per skill.

<a id="ts-4"></a>**TS-4.** Mnemonic must serve list and detail endpoints for agents, skills, and commands so a sync
client can discover and retrieve any item individually.

## Administration

<a id="ad-1"></a>**AD-1.** Mnemonic must expose an administrative API for all write operations: creating, updating,
and deleting patterns, agents, skills, and commands.

<a id="ad-2"></a>**AD-2.** The admin API must return structured error responses so that scripts and CI pipelines can
detect and handle failures programmatically.

<a id="ad-3"></a>**AD-3.** The admin API must support listing patterns with filtering by tag and full-text search on
name and description.

<a id="ad-4"></a>**AD-4.** The admin API must accept pattern uploads and immediately acknowledge them, completing
semantic enrichment asynchronously in the background.

<a id="ad-5"></a>**AD-5.** The admin API must expose an endpoint to manually trigger retry of failed enrichment jobs.

## Observability

<a id="ob-1"></a>**OB-1.** Mnemonic must emit structured logs for all incoming requests on both the admin and MCP
interfaces, including method, path, status code, and latency.

<a id="ob-2"></a>**OB-2.** Mnemonic must expose a health check endpoint that indicates whether the service and its
storage dependencies are ready to serve traffic.

<a id="ob-3"></a>**OB-3.** Mnemonic must expose metrics sufficient to monitor request rates, error rates, and latency
for both the admin API and MCP server.

<a id="ob-4"></a>**OB-4.** Mnemonic must log enrichment job activity, including successful completions, failures, and
retry attempts.

## Security

<a id="se-1"></a>**SE-1.** In MVP (local deployment), Mnemonic may operate without authentication, as it runs in
a trusted network environment.

<a id="se-2"></a>**SE-2.** In production (Post-MVP), the admin API must be protected by
infrastructure-layer authentication and authorization. The MCP interface may remain unauthenticated
within a trusted internal network.

<a id="se-3"></a>**SE-3.** Mnemonic must never store user credentials or session tokens.

<a id="se-4"></a>**SE-4.** The MCP interface must be read-only. No write operations may be performed through it.

<a id="se-5"></a>**SE-5.** In production, all external traffic must be carried over TLS.

<a id="se-6"></a>**SE-6.** Database credentials must not be embedded in the deployed service. They must be injected
from the runtime environment.

## Deployment

<a id="dp-1"></a>**DP-1.** Mnemonic must be deployable to both local development and production environments.

<a id="dp-2"></a>**DP-2.** Mnemonic must be stateless. All persistent state must reside in external storage so that
multiple instances can run without coordination.

<a id="dp-3"></a>**DP-3.** Mnemonic must manage its own database schema versioning, ensuring the schema is always
consistent with the running version.

## Scope Boundaries

Mnemonic's scope is knowledge storage and tooling synchronization. The following boundaries define
what the system is responsible for:

<a id="sb-1"></a>- Mnemonic's only use of external AI services is embedding generation for pattern enrichment.
<a id="sb-2"></a>- All workflow and orchestration decisions belong to the user.
<a id="sb-3"></a>- All tool execution and file operations happen on the client side.
<a id="sb-4"></a>- Identity management and access policy enforcement belong to the infrastructure layer.
<a id="sb-5"></a>- All interaction with Mnemonic is programmatic (API and protocol).
<a id="sb-6"></a>- The primary data store is the source of truth. Secondary stores are eventually consistent.

## Assumptions and Constraints

- Workstations running Claude Code can reach the Mnemonic MCP endpoint over the local or team
  network.
- A team member or CI process takes responsibility for loading and maintaining patterns and tooling
  definitions via the admin API.
- Pattern content is curator-supplied. Mnemonic does not generate or validate content quality.
- The external embedding API (used during pattern enrichment) is available. If it is unavailable,
  enrichment will be retried; patterns will not be searchable until enrichment succeeds.
- Expected pattern counts are in the range of hundreds to tens of thousands, not millions.
- Mnemonic does not enforce multi-tenancy. A single deployment serves one team.
